      <h1>About Me</h1>
      <p>Welcome to my blog! My name is Edward Shin, 
        I am currently a junior at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute. </p>
      <p>I am pursuing a major in computer science, along with a dual major in ITWS (Information Technology and Web Science).</p>
      <p>Although I am interested in software engineering and development as a whole, as you can tell from the name of my second major, which is information technology and web science, 
        I am also interested in full-stack web application development as well!</p>
